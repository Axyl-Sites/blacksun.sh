      We have a variety of different projects, and we have various reasons for why we have picked to move forward with these projects. If you would like to submit projects for
      us to look at, you can do that in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/axyl)

      We are always evaluating new projects and ideas Read more [Here](/en/projects/about-projects)

  <Card title="Our Languages and Tools" icon="open-book">
      We use a variety of languages in our projects, ranging from C, to C#, C++, and Zig, to Lua, Rust, and JavaScript, with a lot of other languages in between.
      if you would like to help, do not be afraid that you dont know a language we use, as even a yaml specialist would be of great help
      We also use Docker, Kubernetes, github, gitlab, grafana, gitea, forgejo, aws, gcp, digital ocean, ghost, and more.

  <Card title="AxylOS" icon="add-document">
      [AxylOS](https://axyl.org) is the Operating System that will kill all operating systems. Open Source, Community Driven, and secure by nature, AxylOS will be the operating system

  <Card title="Axyl Projects Dev Program" icon="star">
      The Axyl Projects Dev Program is a program that is being designed to allow people to work with us and learn marketable skills, in the future we may even have an academy that
      they will be able to come live in, get room and board, and be able to learn and work with us irl.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Axyl Sites" icon="rocket">
      [Axyl Sites](https://github.com/axyl-sites) is the place where Axyl Projects hosts all of the sites that we use for all of our collective projects.
      The idea behind the organization is that it llows us to move any and all of our other projects to instances that we host ourselves
      while still allowing our sites to benifit from all of the integrations that the main github platform has to offer.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Axyl Communties" icon="discord">
      Axyl Projects Communities are communities based around the Axyl Projects. Currently there is only the main community, Axyl Projects, located
      [here](https://discord.gg/axyl)
  </Card>
  <Card title="FOSS Alliance" icon="add-document">
      One of, if not the, biggest issues with the FOSS and OSS ecosystem is the way that it values and undercuts the decentrialized nature of it
      at the same time. This is something that the FOSS Alliance hopes to remedy. The FOSS Alliance is not there to make rules that break down collectives
      and it is not there to act like a judge or interfere with them in any way. The FOSS Alliance aims to uphold a CoC that is usable, as well as provide
      support and advice to new OSS and FOSS Projects that will allow them to maintain their projects. read more [Here](https://alliance.axylprojects.dev)

  <Card title="Helctic" icon="laptop">
    Linux is cool, and it has served as a path maker for things like BSD, as well as other spin off projects that have not lived too long either
    but it is now time for something new, something that people have been waiting for and wanting for a while, something that is being built to be secure
    extendible, open source, and community oriented. Read more about Helctic [Here](https://helctic.dev)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Helsh" icon="rocket">
      There are many reasons why one might hate [SystemD](https://systemd.org), and these may also be the same reasons that they are forced to use
      systemd in the first place. Well Helsh is here to change that. Helsh is being built to be the one thing that is allowed to interact with helctic
      but it is also being built to do the absolute bare minimum and open it up to the end use, OS designer, and almost anyone else who wants to help
      to build the modules that allow helsh to talk to and work with different parts of the system, as well as things that may not even be a part of the system
      but you need the ability to securely use anyway. Read more about Helsh [Here](https://helsh.helctic.dev)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Rustfox" icon="puzzle">
      Rustfox is the future of web browsers. it is firefox, being comepletely redone in rust, and all of the old sync and security features are being replace with secure, modern
      alternatives, and we are also taking a page out of both [Zen Browser](https://zen-browser.app) and [Arc Browser](https://arc.net) and updating the UX/UI to be more functional,
      modern, and usable by everyone. Read more about Rustfox [Here](https://rustfox.dev)

  <Card title="Axyl Bot Service" icon="open-book">
      Axyl Bot Service is the Discord Application Service of the future. Are you tired of useage permits, premium plans, and so many bots that seem to sorta do the same thing but,
      not quite? Well, we are here for you, we are working on a series of open source applications, all managed from a dashboard that you host on your own domain. Don't have a domain?

  <Card title="AWFixer Cloud Services" icon="seti:pipeline">
      [AWFixer Cloud Services](https//awfixer.cloud) is a closed cloud provider that is being built in a special fashion. it is being built in a company first fashion, evaluating company
      needs and then working to build a cloud solution that makes these needs a thing of the past. There will be limited access to the cloud in the future, but if you want to support
      the cloud and maybe even gain early access then you can head over to the [AWFixer Store](https://sales.awfixer.me) and buy or subscribe to something that allows us to build the
      public facing part of the cloud faster.

  <Card title="Alphatek Services" icon="seti:lock">
      Alphatek Services is a Vetran Owned Company that does contract work for other providers to help them, and in the future will do the contract work that allow products made by
      Axyl Projects to be installed, managed and updated within other people networks and clouds. This is an important part of what we hope to do, so as we work to build more things
      we are working to keep them informed and up to date so that they are always able to start helping people with our products and services at a moments notice. you can read more about

  <Card title="Project Remove Stripe" icon="seti:todo">
      Stripe is a mega corporation, which is one of the founding principles that Axyl Projects was created to stand against. The way that it works with stripe is they have efffectively
      created a legal monopoly in the payment processing world. Which is something that cannot happen. They have created a monopoly, and even though there has been effort to maintain the monopoly
      it is indeed because they make a superiour product. This is well and good to a good number of people, but the way that they abuse their power, demand information, from you
      and bully smaller, open source companies, makes it so that there is no way for them to go out, other than as the bad guy. This is the reason for project remove stripe. What happens
      when stripe does fall, where do developers turn, and how much have they invested in using a company that is not promised to be in existance in 20 or 30 years. Read more about project remove stripe
